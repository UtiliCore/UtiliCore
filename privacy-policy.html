  <p>At UtiliCore, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard any data you may provide while using our website and tools. Generally, we do not require personal information such as your name or email address to use our tools. However, if you contact us or subscribe for updates, we may collect such information voluntarily. We also collect non-personal usage data, including your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent on the site.

UtiliCore uses cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience and analyze traffic. You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings. We may work with trusted third-party services like Google Analytics or AdSense for usage tracking and ad display. These services may collect information independently in accordance with their own privacy policies.

We take reasonable measures to secure your data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is entirely secure. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as accessing your data, requesting its deletion, or objecting to certain uses. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at [your email].
